// Visibility is how visible certain members or methods of class are , who can see them ,who can call them and who can use them
//Visibility has no effect on performance of your program it is ust for organizing code
//Three basic visibility modifers are:
//1 private
//2 public
//3 protected
//default visibility of a struct is public
//default visibility of class is private 
class Entity
{
protected://means all sub classes and base class can access these functions and variables butcan't be accessed outside classes
	int P;
	void InitP () {
		P = 0;
		//initializes P to 0
	}
public://Pubic methods and variables can be accessed inside and outside of the class
	int a, b;
	void Init() {
		a = 0;
		b = 0;
	}
private://only entity class can read and write the variables exeption is friend
	int X , Y;
	void print(){
		// Content
		// only this function can be acessed inside the class unless you use friend keyword
	}
public:
	Entity() {
		X = 0;// can initialize x inside the class but can't access it from outside the class unsless you use friend keyword 
	}
